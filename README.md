# School District Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
This project aims to organize and analyze data from 15 different schools. We used the Pandas loc method to look over math an reading scores for Thomas High School, and NumPy to change the math and rading scores to NaN. Additionally, we created a summary of the results based on previous practice, with an updated school summary and DataFrame. 

## Results 
How is the district summary affected?
- The district summary showed a slight decrease in the math from 75% to 74.8%
- The passing summary went down 0.1% from the original 65%

How is the school summary affected?
- The average math score at Thomas High School increased while the average reading score decreased

How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
- There is a negligible effect to the math and reading scores

How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
- Math scores by grade
  - Average score went down 0.1%
- Reading scores by grade
  - Average score remained the same
- Scores by school spending
  - The scores by school spending are very slightly changed by replacing the ninth grade scores
- Scores by school size
  - The scores by school size did not change
- Scores by school type
  - There was no change in scores by school type
